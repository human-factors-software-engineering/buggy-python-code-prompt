### **Running the game**
To run: `python3 asteroids-infinity.py`

### **How To Play**
The objective of the game is to shoot and destroy the asteroids and saucers, while not colliding with either, or being hit by the saucers' counter-fire. The game becomes harder as the number of asteroids increases.

## *Hangman*
### **Running the game**
To run: `python hangman.py`

### **How To Play**
The computer thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the player tries to guess it by suggesting letters, within a certain number of guesses. If the player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the computer writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the computer draws one element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark.

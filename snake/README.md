### **Running the game**
To run: `python snake.py`

### **How To Play**
The player controls the moving dot. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. There is a tail that follows the head and grows longer as the head passes over the red apple. The player loses when the snake runs into itself.

### **Controls**
| Action | Key |
|----:|:---|
|  Change Directions | Arrow Keys  |

### **Issues**
#### 1. The snake's controls are inverted.
When up is pressed the snake goes down and when down is pressed the snake goes up. We want more straightforward behavior where if you press down it goes down and if you press up it goes up.

#### 2. The apple is the wrong color.
The dot the player needs to hit is the wrong color. The dot should be red instead of blue.

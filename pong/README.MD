### **How To Play**
Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. Points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.

### **Controls**
| Action | Key |
|----:|:---|
| Up | Up  |
| Down | Down |

### **Issues**
#### 1. Collision detection of paddles 
Currently when playing the ball flies to the right and flies off the edge of the screen despite a paddle being in the way. Normally the AI should be able to bounce the ball when it collides with a paddle. It is unknown if the player paddle has the same issue.
